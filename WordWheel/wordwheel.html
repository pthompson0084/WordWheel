<!-- Initial JS: 
	1. Pick 4 to 6 unique consonants and 2 to 3 unique vowels at random for a total of 7 letters. If 'Q' picked then 'U' is one of the vowels. Select 1 letter as the "required letter" (but not	'Q', 'Z', 'X', or 'J').
	2. From words.csv, make a list of all words with >= 4 letters of only the selected letters 	and >= 1 of the required letter. 	
	3. If there is not a "pangram" (with all 7 unique letters) in the list or there is an insufficient number of words (< 20), start over with new letters.
	4. Assign each word in the list a point value. 4 letter words = 1 point. Longer words = 1 point per letter. A pangram gets a 7 point bonus.
	5. Display the letters in a wheel shape, with the special letter in the center.
